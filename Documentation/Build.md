## Building using Visual Studio
- Open solution file located in repository root directory with Visual Studio.
- Start __Build solution__ to get things rolling
- If you want to build Visual Studio extension, you need to __Build solution__ one more time (this step is needed only the first time, so that Visual Studio binplaces all dependencies correctly).

## Building using `dotnet` command
- Open console and change directory to repository root
- Type `dotnet build`

## Running tests
Before running tests, you need to download all dumps. Execute `dumps\download.ps1` script to fetch them from JFrog server.

With Visual Studio, you can use __Test Explorer__ to find and execute tests.

Enter `Tests\SharpDebug.Tests.Native` directory. Run `dotnet test` command.
